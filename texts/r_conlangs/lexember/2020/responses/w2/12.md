## ILLNESS
In the early days of the gramurn, illness is not well understood, and is often associated with bad air, bad water, or bad food, all of which are seen as the _rūmniɣaɾku_ spirits being displeased. Common signs of illness are displaying a **xauxauʔ** (cough, sneeze), _ɣuɣuax_ (panting, heavy breating), **haxaʁ** (vomiting or expectorating phlegm), and **rūmruki** (exhaustion, fatigue). Most illness in this stage of the language is described by its symptoms rather than having specific names. (3/x)
## INJURY
While some injuries are obvious, especially those which draw _ɾaкim_ (blood) or which involve _miʀxigai_ (**broken**) _miumuʔku_ (bones), there are other injuries like **rūmxulm** (bruises) and those which inflict **iāruki** (coma, literally "great sleep"). (+3, 6/x)
## HEALING
Minor injuries are usually treated by _ɰaɰum_ (**licking**) and _кɰaʀim_ (clothes, dressing) with simple fibers if necessary. A larger injury may involve a needle used to _кɰāum_ (sew) the injury closed, or even a **miʔikmiʔar** (splint) to set broken bones. In the case of _iāruki_, the typical treatment is to _niɣaɾxigai_ (pray) that the spriits will return life to the injured.

In the case of illness, prayer is a common part of treatment, but _rukāklauma_ (medicinal herbs and plants) are often _ʔiʀaniɾau_ (boiled, brewed, steeped) and may be served to the patient as a drink, or applied in the form of **niɣaɾhuʔ** (salve, poultice, medicinal remedy). (+3, 9/x)

It is worth noting that within the world of Atrusius, where the gramurn live, spirits can be demonstrated to exist, and are able to help treat illnesses and injuries, so prayer can sometimes be quite effective.
