## Drinks of Pleasure

While the most common drink of the early gramurn is doubtless _niɣɾaк_ or simple water, they often **niɾau** (soak or infuse in water) whole or solid pieces of fruit or vegetable to give it flavor. At night, they will also often **ʔiʀiʀan** (cook; lit. "fire" with the initial syllable rhyme reduplicated) their water and **ʔiʀaniɾau** (brew or steep, lit. "fire-soak") herbs and mashed fruit in it.

After returning from a hunt, especially if bringing a bounty of fruits along with their prey, excess fruits will be mashed into a pulp and left in **xugniɣɾaк** (waterskins, lit. "carry-water") until they are used, often in ritual purposes. When not out hunting, drinks are usually served in **ɣuang** (bowl) made from hardened fruit shells, carved wood, or fired clay. (5/x)

## Primary Foods & Preparation

As primary carnivores, the act of **ɾaкimxulm** (draining blood) is one of the most important steps in preparing a kill to eat, especially if the meat is to be _ʔiʀiʀan_ (cooked). The three primary forms of _ʔiʀiʀan_ are **ʔuraʔiʀan** (to cook by fire, specifically by laying meat on a fire-heated surface), _ʔiʀaniɾau_ (to boil, brew, or steep, this word is used for preparing soups or stews), and **raмukiʀan** (to cook for a long time by leaving food over a fire or embers, especially to smoke food)

All meat can be referred to as _nauɾm_ (when formed into a noun, this means both generic "food," and specifically "meat"), while other foods include _klauma_ (all edible grains), and **naurūm** for fruits or vegetables.

By mixing _klauma_ and _niɣɾaк_, various forms of **nexik** (dough) can be made, which can be cooked into **ʔuraux** (bread, roll) by direct heat, **nilaiʔ** (dumpling) when boiled, or **ɣauɣung** (hardtack, a dense bread usually soaked before being eaten). (13/x)

## Treats

The most common treats among the early gramurn are sweet fruits like **haiʔling** (a form of berry which is very tart and juicy), **huʔamrūm** (winterseed, _leng'eni isa_, coconut\*; a hard-shelled fruit with a pulpy fruit meat and milky juice stored up in the center), and **kuigaix** (a pear-like fruit which grows readily and can be harvested twice a year).

For adults, the drinks _naмiχam_ (mead) and **muʔlingam** (cider) are treats often used during winter or at celebratory feasts. (17/17)
