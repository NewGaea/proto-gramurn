# Proto-Gramurn: Day 8 - The Biological Imperative

Welcome back to another day of actually new words for Proto-Gramurn! Last week, I got 70 new words in 6 days, and then just shared a list of kinship terms for the matrilneal system of the early Gramurn, but now that we've dealt with the first full week, let's get a bit more serious.

Today, we've been prompted with the real biological imperative, continuing your species, and personal, lineage.

## ATTRACTION

The gramurn recognize several types of attraction, including **kiuʔ** (attraction to things which are cute, clean, well-made, or friendly), **hauгu** (attraction to strength and capability), **ulaʔun** (attraction to beauty and health), and **lūxuaʔ** (attraction on purely _reproductive_ terms). +4 (4/x)

## MATING

The gramurn, as semi-nomadic hunters, did not have an early tradition of possessive mating, or marriage, and hunting packs would often refrain from _reproductive interactions_ while afield. They recognize three broad types of _mating_ activities:

**nairumruki** (_drink sleep_) refers to grooming the fur outside of bathing, particularly removing lice, ticks, fleas, and other pests from oneself or a partner. The word is also used to decribed a type of _mating_ interaction focused on oral and surface interactions, something we might call _foreplay_.

**ɣuɣuaxraɰn** (_sweat knee_) refers to more intimate actions taken for the sake of physical pleasure. In the mundane, it can refer to washing a partner while bathing, or providing a form of massage, or even providing companionship during sleep. In the context of _mating_, the term refers to _intimacy_ other than for the purpose of producing offspring (and especially among the same sex).

**mināʔu** refers to the type of performances a male seeking a female to bear pups will engage in. Females are seen as having the power in this relationship, and the goal of such displays is usually to evoke feelings of _hauru_ in the prospective mother. The results of such courtship are usually only for a single mating cycle, as gramurn seek to have several mates over the course of their lives.

**ʀaumaʔ** (_woman grow_) refers to mating interactions exclusively between a male and female, and specifically to those which could _conceivably_ lead to the female, well, conceiving.

In addition to the above, the six-month cycle between the dry summer and winter has led to most gramurn experiencing a biochemical impulse to seek out _ʀaumaʔ_ around these times of year (though more modern Gramurn simply have a cycle of about six months), and they call these times the **maʔnaumuʔ** (_growing moon_) or mating season. +5 (9/x)

## BIRTH

Due to the _maʔnaumuʔ_, it is common for gramurn females to give birth at similar times. During these times, the hunters who mated with the birthing mothers are expected to go on a hunt to provide a feast for the tribe or clan to celebrate the newborn pups. The hunt, and ensuing feast, is called **riʔhaulʁux**, or the "life gift." During the feast, mothers and nursemaids nurse the young while also providing them their first taste of meat, which has been well chewed by the nursing females.

Children born in the same season were once raised as a tribal family, but as gramurn society become more settled, homes did develop that kept siblings closer to each other than to the rest of the tribe's young. +1 (10/x)

## GENDER (NOT SEX) (includes TRANS & INTERSEX)

Early Gramurn did not have much luxury for separating gender from sex, but they did recognize that there was more than one way to be a man or woman. _graʔ_ is a neutral word for a heroic or great person, and modern terms for "gender non-conforming individuals" developed from a long history where Proto-Gramurn used **kuaʔʀau** (crop-planting woman) and **ɾaкimʔiʁg** (blood man).

_kuaʔʀau_ are treated in all ways as women, though they may have been born with the appearance expected of a man (they may also simply be infertile). It is believed that this name was given to them because at the time of planting, pregnant women are often unable to participate in crop planting, but women who are incapable of being pregnant are able to help the men.

_ɾaкimʔiʁg_ are treated in all ways as men, though they may have been born with the appearance expected of a woman, or as an intersex individual with both sets of reproductive organs. _ɾaкimʔiʁg_ typically take the male role in courtship during the mating season, even if they are courting males and seeking to become pregnant. It is believed that this name was given to them because they are seen as more vicious than the other men around them.

While they may not actually be used for derivation in the future, **hiaʔмaχ** (_two oneself_) would be the _proper_ word for intersex individuals. **migмaχ** (_across oneself_) would be the _proper_ word for transgender individuals. +4 (14/x)
