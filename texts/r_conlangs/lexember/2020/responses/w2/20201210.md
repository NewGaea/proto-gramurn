# Proto-Gramurn Day 10: Shelter

I'm going to split this up a little bit differently from the main post. As an overview, early Gramurn had three major types of shelter -- natural shelters, temporary or portable shelters, and long-term shelters.

## NATURAL SHELTER

## PORTABLE SHELTER

## DURABLE SHELTER

_ʔian_ is the stem for a house, home, or den. In the early age, most long-term gramurn homes are built on **ɰukra** stilts or struts, with a **гauhang** ladder or ramp that can be raised or hidden to keep unwelcome visitors out. The earliest windows and doors are made of **niɣaɾʔiʔiux**, "sky-paper," which is made of **ʔiʔiux** (woven reed paper) stretched taut across a wooden frame and coated in **uguʔin** or animal glue. Other parts of a house include **uʀaxu** (floor), _miʔar_ (in this context, walls), and _hang_ (in this context, roof). +6 words, +2 senses.
