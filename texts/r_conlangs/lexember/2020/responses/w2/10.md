# Proto-Gramurn Day 10: Shelter

I'm going to split this up a little bit differently from the main post. As an overview, early Gramurn had three major types of shelter -- natural shelters, temporary or portable shelters, and long-term shelters.

## NATURAL SHELTER

_guʔmaʔi_ is the simplest (and most temporary) form of natural shelter, an evergreen tree introduced on day 3 with thick branches and trunk seen as suitable for taking shelter from rain or snow. By laying out sturdy _гalaʔiaku_, a **guʔian** may be made, something like a hideout or a hunting tent beneath the boughs of a _guʔmaʔi_ or other tree. **aɣamiʀ** (literally "in earth") refers to a hollow or cave, while **aɣamiʔar** refers to a hollow within a tree (though such hollows are typically too small for gramurn, they may hide small game).

## PORTABLE SHELTER

**ʔaχɰu** refers to a tent made of **miʀmiʔar** (sturdy posts) which may be driven into the ground and pulled back up, usually with several **ralaku** (stem: _rala_) or sheets sewn together to serve as walls, and an **iāralaʔia** (large blanket, in this context "roofing blanket") attached to **hangmiʔar** (roofing posts) laid atop the _ʔaχɰu_.

## DURABLE SHELTER

_ʔian_ is the stem for a house, home, or den. In the early age, most long-term gramurn homes are built on **ɰukra** stilts or struts, with a **гauhang** ladder or ramp that can be raised or hidden to keep unwelcome visitors out. The earliest windows and doors are made of **niɣaɾʔiʔiux**, "sky-paper," which is made of **ʔiʔiux** (woven reed paper) stretched taut across a wooden frame and coated in **uguʔin** or animal glue. Other parts of a house include **uʀaxu** (floor), **_miʔar_** (in this context, walls), and **_hang_** (in this context, roof). +6 words, +2 senses.
