# Proto-Gramurn Day 9: Covering the Body

Heh. I've been having fun with this, and it helps take my mind off a bit of the stress of working in a retail-adjacent occupation during the holiday season. What covers the body? Skin, scales, feathers?

Reminder: **bold words** are new for Lexember, _italic words_ are pre-existing (including words already introduced in this post).

## SKIN

**huʔau** is the layer of flesh that protects meat from the elments, particularly on creatures with thin fur. **luixa** is scaled skin, as on lizards or fish, **mug** is fur or body hair -- **namug** is thin fur, and **hauʔmug** is thick fur. In addition to this **ɣrauʔmug** is fur taken from a _ɣrauʔ_ (animal valued for useful products other than meat) similar to wool. +6 (6/x)

## TEXTILE PRODUCTION

In this era, Gramurn really only know three ways to create textiles: **taʔnaɣ** is the art of preserving hides, **alauka** is the process of twisting fibers together, _uкɰaru_ is the process of weaving or interlacing strips of plant or animal fibers together, and _кɰā_ is the process of binding fabric together with a bone needle and threaded fiber.

_taʔnaɣ_ produces **lunuaʔa**, leather or preserved hides. _alauka_ produces **guʔaika**, thread, string, or ropes depending on how many times it is twisted or braided. _uкɰaru_ usually produces **kuakiu**, which is cloth or paper (more on paper tomrrow!), especially in sheets. _кɰā_ produces _кɰaʀim_, meaning covering or clothing, though some _кɰaʀim_ is also produced by _uкɰaru_. +5 (11/x)

## CLOTHING

Early gramurn relied on their fur and shelters for the majority of their protection from the elements, so much of their clothing was for ritual purposes or protection from extreme weather.

During mating rituals, it is common to wear a **uruʔкɰaʀim** (loincloth) decorated to demonstrate one's virility and confidence. This is derived from the word **uruʔ** which is a body word I missed the other day -- it refers to the groin, crotch, or loin, and not to the reproductive organs themselves.

**гalaʔia**, or blankets, are sheets of fabric cut to size and sewn together with another sheet or a hide to provide coverage from heavy rain, strong winds, and the cold, especially while sleeping. When a woman gives a courting male her _гalaʔia_, it means she has accepted him as a mate (this time).

**laʔuankua**, a type of light cloak, are thick sheets of fabric that have been tied together, and are worn for slight protection from the elements, and visual concealment in forests or at night. A gramurn cloak often has a hood and is closed or held together around the throat, without sleeves. A cloak typically extends to the waist so it does not drag on the ground when a gramurn enters hunting stance (on all four of their paws.) +4 (15/15)
