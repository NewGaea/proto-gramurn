"nightstone"), and **мaiamu** (basalt), though some tools are made out of bones instead of stone, and a few tool are favorably made out of wood, particularly if they can be made from **мiʔaɻamiʔar** (mithral, a wood which can be dried in the sun to produce a very hard and fire-resistant material; lit.
