Another day, a fresh batch of words for **Proto-Gramurn**! It's a shame I fell behind so early on, but I will try to complete each day.

# Fish

Early gramurn lived in forests, and rarely hunted for fish during their hunting months, only preying on them when desperate. **χiniʔua** is the stem for fish, or prey which lives underwater. **χinʔuaga** is the stem for dangerous animals of the waters, such as sharks or whales.

**mulχiniʔua** is a large river-dwelling fish in the plains and forests. It is known for burrowing into the soft riverbed to hide, and is considered both easy and valuable prey compared to most fish. It is hunted during the dry summer months, when the need for hydration keeps nomadic clans near what water sources they have. The name literally translates as "sunfish."

**gaumχiniʔua** is a lake-dwelling fish which is known for its size and slimy skin (the slime is considered medicinal). Most clans and tribes have wintering grounds near lakes that host these fish, and the last hunts of the homecoming and harvest season are for the largest _gaumχiniʔua_ in the lake. After harvesting their slime, these fish are cooked in smokehuts to provide meat for the winter months. +4 (4/x)

# Bird

While waterfowl such as _harxul_ and _riкaм_ came from filling in the Swadesh list, there are no other birds included in the lexicon so far. **luʔiāl** is the common word for a small (non-aquatic) bird unsuitable for hunting, **līnauʔla** is a large non-predatory bird suitable for hunting, **ɾiɾauki** is a predatory bird suitable for hunting or taming, and **hakuʔlu** is a dangerous predatory bird.

One particularly notable predatory bird in the modern world is the _rk'nary_ (established word, also not from Proto-Gramurn), which is large enough to be valuable if tamed, and has been domesticated for generations among both the gramurn peoples and the orks of Atrusius. Each culture claims the name to be historically their own, but linguists are uncertain which truly owns the claim to the historical lineage, as both languages are unrelated apart from explicit borrowings. +4 (8/x)

# Insect

Insects are divided into two broad groups: **мarrauk** are insects which are capable of flying, while **guʔiā** are insects which do not fly. Of course, there are some specific examples I'd like to describe:

**ɾaкinauɾm** are "blood eaters" -- a type of _мarrauk_ that are known for finding any thin patch of fur and using their piercing proboscis to suck blood out of their victims. While an unladen _ɾaкinauɾm_ has an insignificant weight, they will become bloated as they drain blood, and their blood sac will explode if they are swatted. _ɾaкinauɾm_ are pests, but they are tolerated because they fertilize a wide variety of berry bushes when they are not drawing blood.

**aʔliʔū** are spider-like insects (they are not arachnids) which spend most of their lives spinning webs, and capturing other pestilential insects. **kauʔian** are similar insects, except that they are predatory, and instead of spinning webs to capture prey, they use their webs to construct shelters and conceal themselves. +5 (13/x)

# Cattle

In the early days of their development, the Gramurn did not domesticate animals, though they did have some animals they hunted for purposes other than meat. The word _ʔaga_ refers to animals suitable for hunting as food -- sadly, all of these are from my base wordlist, and do not count as new. The animals listed below are not necessarily native animals, but are similar enough to the ideas referred to by each type of animal.

_xikuʔ_ are long-legged hoofed mammals similar to deer, gazelles, zebra, goats, or horses. _ɣrauʔ_ are animals considered most useful for their fur, hides, or bones -- the term refers to animals like goats, sheep, or _drakes_. _rikaul_ are dangerous animals (often predators) that are valued as tests of strength, such as bears, elephants, lions, and apes. _gaum_ are dangerous animals which are not predators and which are valuable as food, in particular wild boars or pigs, or other prey animals with tusks or horns. +0

# Beast

The root word for a beast is _iāʔaga_, literally composed of "big + game animal." Some types of these include the above-mentioned *rikaul* and *gaum*. A specific type of beast is the **мuraiʔuk**, or the *drake* mentioned above, a lizard known for eating rocks, sleeping, growing to great sizes, and spitting or breathing magic -- essentially a *dragon*, except that *drakes* are pack creatures which resemble short hoofed animals from a distance. Drakes are not valued for meat, but for just about everything else in their bodies. +1 (14/14)
