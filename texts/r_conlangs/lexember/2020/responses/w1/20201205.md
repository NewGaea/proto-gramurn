More and more work for **Proto-Gramurn**, this time getting into conceptions of personhood. The Gramurn are from a fantasy world with other sentient races, but this early in their development, they are isolated enough on their island continent to not encounter other races of people...

# Person

From the original Swadesh wordlist, we already have the words _min_ for person, _ʔiʁg_ for male or man, _ʀau_ for female, and _graʔ_ for a heroic or accomplished person. +0 (0/x)

# Adult

Gramurn of these times did not consider the sex or gender of children -- only those who had grown, learned to hunt, and become **ukixulmin**, or hunters (literally, "new killer," in reference to the rite of passage from child to adult being to make a kill during a pack hunt). There are those who are chosen by the spirits, and some of those avoid this rite of passage, instead being **xraʔhiaʔмiʔaɻa** or "second-birthed" as adults. After about a year, these titles make way to the simple terms for adults, or **ʀiaкɣūɾ** for the spirit-chosen. +3 (3/x)

# Child

All children are **krixмaχ** (youngling) or **krixgrāl** (young wolf) to outsiders. **krixʔāмaur** (young name) are simple descriptive words or phrases used to refer to children, replaced with one or more names assigned, or chosen, after they are elevated to adulthood. +3 (6/x)

# Friend

Friendship as a modern concept is believed to have been unfamiliar to the early Gramurn, though many words could be suffixed with _-мaχ_ (one, oneself) to indicate a particular type of relationship, such as **мiʔaɻaмaχ** (birth-one) to refer to a sexual partner or mate, **ɣūɾмaχ** (say-one) to refer to a teacher or mentor, or **ɣuxuмaχ** (naked-one) to refer to a confidant. +3.5 (9.5/x)

# Humanity*

To the gramurn, there is a sense of **χuaɾмaχ** that exists throughout a tribe or clan. While both components of this word are pronouns on their own, the combination is a feeling of belonging and community, or camaraderie, family, friendship, etc. Of course, this is only within a clan -- clans and tribes split off when disagreements arise, or when numbers grow too large, and the males of one tribe may wind up in several tribes that have nearby hunting grounds as they become ready to mate.

The sense of kinship between such tribes is **iāχuaɾмaχ** (big togetherness), and the sense of being a unified race is **grālχuaɾмaχ** (wolf kinship, or "gramurnity"). +3 (12.5/x)

**Running Total: 55 new words,** plus a more defined derivational sense for one of my pre-existing words.
