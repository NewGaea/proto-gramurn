**Proto-Gramurn**:

Proto-gramurn is a proto-protolanguage, and while i have a little bit of a wordlist, I haven't developed much vocabulary or grammar for it yet. We'll start off with the words I do have, and then I'll derive a few for the sake of Lexember. Of note, not all of the symbols I use are standard IPA, because their alien anatomy enables them to produce some sounds humans can't, or can't easily, pronounce -- I'll make a post about their phonology soon, but for now, we'll just have words spelled out.

1. **SUN** \- **mul** /mul/ *noun stem;* element of **mulgai** meaning *east*. At this stage in their development, the sun is not seen as a star -- it marks the time when prey animals are most active and alert, and when early gramurn would tend to retreat to their dens.
   1. **dusk** \- **argmul** /arg mul:/ *noun* \- the period of time when the sun is leaving the sky, literally means "red sun." Most early gramurn would wake up in the late afternoon, share in the remnants of their hunting pack's last kill, and ready themselves for another night of hunting. 1/x
2. **MOON - naumuʔ** /nau: muʔ/ *noun stem;* a large celestial body in the night sky.As the homeworld of the gramurn has three moons, this word is primarily used in plural forms to refer to any or all of the moons.
   1. **grālgaix** \- the white moon which cycles roughly every 28 days, the name of this moon is "the wolf-eye" 2/x
   2. **krixgaix** \- the blue moon which cycles roughly every 16 days, the name of this moon is "the young eye" 3/x
   3. **мuinagaix** \- the red moon which cycles roughly every 42 days, the name of this moon is "the elder eye" 4/x
3. **STAR - ɣuʀ** /ɣuʀ/ *noun stem;* a small light in the sky during dawn and dusk.The gramurn visual system shifts from processing light intensity and wavelengths during the day to intensity and thermal radiation during the night, or more specifically when the ambient light intensity drops too low. This means that stars are less visible to gramurn at night than they are during twilight hours.
   1. **planet - guxaiɣuʀ** /gu: xai ɣuʀ/ *noun* \- a star which moves in more than one direction over time, literally a "plowing star" 5/
   2. **constellation - namaʔɣuʀ** /na: maʔ ɣuʀ/ *noun* \- a star or stars that may be used for guidance, physically or mystically, literally a "recognized star" or a "known star" 6/
4. **WORLD - miʀ** /miʀ/ *noun stem* \- earth, land, dirt, rocks, world. Literally referring to earth or stones, many words derived from *miʀ* refer to working the land or the shape of the land, but for today, I'll be adding two words to describe the sort of life on the land:
   1. **ɣrauʔmiʀ** /ɣrauʔ: miʀ/ *noun* \- plains, fields, grasslands, especially those where docile prey live, literally "sheep land" 7/
   2. **ʔagamiʀ** /ʔa ga: miʀ/ *noun* \- hunting grounds, particularly those inhabited by large and protective prey, literally "game animal land" 8/
5. **SKY - niɣaɾ** /ni: ɣaɾ/ *noun stem* \- the realm of flying creatures and heavenly events. Referring to the realm(s) above the heads of these early folk, the sky is considered mysterious and fickle. Many words derived from *niɣaɾ* refer to the supernatural or things beyond the understanding of early gramurn.
   1. **wildfire, lightning - niɣaɾʔiʀan** /niɣaɾʔiʀan/ - even the early gramurn know that lightning can cause fires, and so they call it "the sky's fire," and they refer to all wildfires in the same way. 9/9
