## The Purpose of this List

There are several collections of specimen sentences to translate into a conlang, including 1200 sentences on this web site. As a general rule the sources for these sentences have been elementary-level educational publications meant to provide a student with rote practise exercises. This means that the same sentence structure will appear many times with only slight variations in the nouns and verbs used. For example, these sentences from 1200 Graded Sentences for Analysis:

- A cheerful fire is blazing on the hearth.
- Seven little sisters were walking in a row.
- Some beautiful roses are blooming in our garden.
- The boys are playing in the lot.
- The little girl was playing with her kitten.

Granted, these sentences may use different conjugations of a verb, and different declensions of the various nouns and pronouns, but aside from those trivial difference, these sentences are essentially identical with respect to the syntactical features they are meant to test or demonstrate. That kind of repetition is fine for rote training, but it is not really necessary for testing a conlang. To serve that purpose there needs to be only one sentence of the type: "Roses are red."

What is necessary is a variety of unique sentences each of which tests some different aspect of the conlang. This collection was constructed by putting together several more repetitive lists and culling out that larger collection, those sentences which duplicate syntactic principles already present earlier in the list.

Below are 218 sentences selected from a collection of 1200 sentences, with all those that are essentially duplicates removed.

Some sentences have been slightly modified to remove references to a specific culture or time, to make the sentence more "universal" for conlangs of any era or culture. For example "We went to London..." has been changed to "We went to the village...". In other sentences allowances will have to made for conlangs from cultures that don't have Mondays, windows, or snow. The important thing is whether the conlang being tested can handle the meaning of sentences of that general structure.
