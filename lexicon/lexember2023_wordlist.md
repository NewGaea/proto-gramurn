# Lexember 2023 Lexicon

The following wordlist is sorted by Day and the order words (or senses) were coined within the response.

Note that any entry below which ends a gloss with an asterisk \* means that gloss is a meta-gloss, comparing the word to something which exists in our world, but not necessarily in Atrusius, the world where Proto-Gramurn developed.

## 1. Hunting & Animal Parts

> Tonight we hunted a great elk. It will feed the tribe well, but we are cleaning it carefully for our stock of **sinew** for bows is running low. We can shape many tools from the **large bones** and after the *hu?au* and is off the body, the fishers will clean the *mug* to decide if it will be *alauku* into threads or *кɰā* into coverings. This prey is a blessing, and from it's **horns** to its **hooves** we will waste nothing.

## 2. Foraging & Plant Parts

I also did a batch of words replated to plants back in 2020, which can be seen at [lexember2020_wordlist](https://github.com/NewGaea/proto-gramurn/blob/main/lexicon/lexember2020_wordlist.md) under Day 3. I may have set my target a bit high for words today...

:leaf_korok: **\<laklu> /laklu/** _noun._ 1. leaf, petal; a decorative leaf or petal gathered and used for visual purposes or dyes; possibly a later development than aromatic (_ūxanaʔklauma_) or medicinal (*/rukāklauma/*) "grain" terms, may even have _klu_ as a shortened form of _klauma_?
:leaf_korok: **\<mu'va> /muʔɣa/** _noun._ 1. fine root, as of flowers or grains, contrasts with edible roots (/*muxai*/) and the roots of trees
:leaf_korok: **\<vui> /ɣui/** _noun._ 1. thick roots, as of trees; especially roots which break the ground's surface
:leaf_korok: **\<zig>** _noun._ 1. neck, throat 2. spine 3. stem of a flower, leaf, or fruit
:leaf_korok: **\<klaumiR> /klaumiʀ/** _noun._ 1. pollen, spores 2. plant dust, finely ground plant matter; a combination of grain (_klauma_) and earth (_/miʀ/_)  roughly "flower dust"
:leaf_korok: **\<mi'anaurm> /miʔanauɾm/** _noun._ 1. fungus, especially mushrooms some and edible molds; a combination of wood (_/miʔar/_) and to eat (_/nauɾm/_)
:leaf_korok: **\<Ru> /ʀu/** _noun._ 1. erru, a sweet berry which is associated with the cold seasons 2. any berry or fruit which is primarily sweet
:leaf_korok: **\<vam> /ɣam/** *descriptor* 1. sour, acidic 2. puckered 3. _noun._ guamba, a sour berry which is associated with the hot season 4. any berry or fruit which is primarily sour
:leaf_korok: **\<mwuxi> /mɰuxi/** _noun._ 1. mwuxi, a bitter berry which is associated with the dry seasons, both hot and cold 2. any berry which is primarily bitter
:leaf_korok: **\<dux> /ɻux/** _noun._ 1. needle, quill, spike; may refer to the needles of evergreen trees, the quills of certain animals, an artificial needle used for sewing (/*kwāum*/) or a skewer used to prepare food (and some other types of spikes)

## 3. Water

I did some water related terms and water animals in 2020. They can be found in [lexember2020_wordlist](https://github.com/NewGaea/proto-gramurn/blob/main/lexicon/lexember2020_wordlist.md)
under day 4 for the fish, and day 11 for cooking with water.

:book_mudora: **\<nivraK> /niɣɾaк/** _root noun._ 1. water, drink
:book_mudora: **\<nivraKmi'ik> /niɣɾaкmiʔik/** _noun._ 1. lake, river

Well, I was never happy with "water-place" just being a lake or a river, so I'm going to adjust that now. The former word _can_ refer to any notable body of water, but we now have two new words:

:leaf_korok: **\<nivrun> /niɣɾun/** _modified root noun._ 1. pond, lake; a relatively still body of freshwater
:leaf_korok: **\<xaivtaK> /xaiɣɾaк/** _noun._ 1. river, stream; a flowing body of freshwater, from _guxai_ "to plow" and _niɣɾaк_ "water"
:leaf_korok: **\<niv'ura> /niɣʔuɾa/** _noun._ 1. waterfall 2. epiphany, sudden insight, sudden understanding
:leaf_korok: **\<nivraKlauma> /niɣɾaкlauma/** 1. watergrass, kelp, seaweed
:leaf_korok: **\<nivaaraK> /niɣāɾaк/** 1. rain

## 4. Land & Terrain

I actually used a lot of polysemy for land related terms last time I did Lexember, and focused on their primary environments. I picked nine words to work on today -- but first we'll go over the ones I already have:

:book_mudora: **\<avamiR> /aɣamiʀ/** _noun._ 1. a hollow, a cave, a cavern; particularly one in the earth
:book_mudora: **\<iaamiR> /iāmiʀ/** _noun._ 1. a mound, a hill 2. a mountain, particularly a non-volcanic mountain
:book_mudora: **\<mi'armi'ar> /miʔarmiʔar/** _noun._ 1. forest, woodland; particularly temperate
:book_mudora: **<'iRaniaamiR> /ʔiʀaniāmiʀ/** _noun._ 1. mountain, volcano 2. geyser

:leaf_korok: **<vrauni'miR> /ɣrauniʔmiʀ/** _noun._ 1. desert, wasteland; a land which does not grow grass
:leaf_korok: **\<Mimanuv mi'armi'ar> /мimanuɣ miʔarmiʔar/** _noun._ 1. jungle, rainforest; applies to any deep, dark woodland with a thick canopy
:leaf_korok: **\<avamiRmiR> /aɣamiʀmir/** _noun._ 1. lakeland, wetland, swamp, marsh; any sort of freshwater wetlands
:leaf_korok: **\<'uramiR> /ʔuramiʀ/** _noun._ 1. lowland, valley, canyon
## 5. Features & Environs
Today, I'm going to cover a few more specific features that you might need to help direct someone from place A to place B -- some are names, but I'll get a few postpositionals too (Proto-Gramurn handles positional clauses after the noun they refer to).

:leaf_korok: **\<mulnivar> /mulniɣaɾ/** 1. _noun, postposition._ sunrise, east; the time of day when Gramurn finish working and start spending times with their closest kin to prepare for sleep
:leaf_korok: **\<mulmiR> /mulmiʀ/** 1. _noun, postposition._ sunset, west; where the sun and moons sink to the earth
:leaf_korok: **\<miusnivar> /miuχniɣaɾ/** 1. _noun, postposition._ snowsky, cold lands, north; the homeland of the gramurn sits almost entirely north of the equator, so colder areas are associated with the north
:leaf_korok: **\<kaulamiR> /kaulamiʀ/** 1. _noun._ heartland, the central plains and fields of Mermag
:leaf_korok: **\<iaanivraKmiR> /iāniɣɾaкmiʀ/** 1. _noun._ island, peninsula; a land which juts up from the water on most or all sides
:book_mudora: **\<Mimanuv mi'armi'ar> /мimanuɣ miʔarmiʔar/** 1. _noun._ jungle, rainforest :leaf_korok: 2. _postposition._ toward the dark forests, south

:leaf_korok: **\<riran\> /ɾiɾan/** 1. _root stem._ bend, turn, to change direction

:leaf_korok: **\<tiukaal> /ɾiukāl/** 1. _root stem._ back, reverse, to fix, turnback
## 6. ~~Shelter~~ Pottery

I've been following my own plan thus far, but today... no. I already did quite a nice summary of shelter options for the early Gramurn for [Lexember 2020, Day 10](https://github.com/NewGaea/proto-gramurn/blob/main/texts/r_conlangs/lexember/2020/responses/w2/10.md) and didn't even finish that until March 2022. I had already coined 100 words by Day 10 and just kind of dropped out from there... So today, I'm going to pick my own theme. **Pottery.**
### Materials
Gramurn pottery may be made out of :leaf_korok: **\<miRnivraK> /miʀniɣɾaк/** (mud, literally "earthwater") or :leaf_korok: **<'iamuuRuk> /ʔiamūʀuk/**, with different qualities between them. _miRnivraK_ is used in dry environments and is less able to be worked with fine detail, while *'iamuuRuk* is used in both wet and dry forms -- and environments -- for different purposes.

Due to its softness, mud is usually mixed with _klauma_ (grain), specifically the dried stalks of grain crops, and shaped by hand. For more structured shapes, sticks and twigs may be used. While :leaf_korok: **\<miRnivraK miRmiR>** (mud stones) of this sort can be useful for building, they are usually of relatively rough consistency and are vulnerable to excessive weathering in heavy storms. They also cannot be used near bodies of water, so they are primarily upper exterior wall building materials.

<*'iamuuRuk*> on the other hand get used for far more uses. **\<'muvu'a> /muɣuʔa/** are mudstone or clay furnaces, often used to cook food, but also \<*'iamuuRuk*> pottery, **\<Ru'mun> /ʀuʔmun/** (charcoal), and to melt \<'*iRanmiR*> (copper) and other metals with a low melting point. 
## Products
While the simplest product to make is a **\<taavik> /ɹāɣik/** (brick), many forms of **\<mui'hun> /muiʔhun/** (pottery, clayworks) are made in this era. The largest were **\<mutuuzi> /muɹūʁi/** (amphora, large vase) in which fresh water and alcoholic drinks (mead and ciders, see Lexember 2020) would be stored. Until use, they would be sealed with a fitted top and skypaper (Lexember 2020) with an extra glue coating over the seal to keep anything from getting in.

**\<kawhi> /kaɰhi/** are smaller vases suitable for carrying and used for serving the drinks previously stored in _taaviku_ and often had a handle and spout to aid in this use. **\<'uam> /uam/** is a form of long shallow bowl with an exterior flattened surface -- a drinking bowl used for soups, stews, and beverages. In fact, even to the modern day, most gramurn drinking bowls are designed to be a bit oblong, to make sipping easy.

**\<wuDe> /wure/** (fetish, totem, small idol) are made of a variety of materials, including clay. While any spirit or god may have a \<**wuDe**> of any material, clay \<**wuDe**> are favored for their relative permanence.

# 08 - Cycles I - Days & Seasons

On an average day, an early Gramurn will **\<nivniwa> /niɣniɰa/** "rise by the sky" around the late afternoon, what we might call around 3-5 PM, or what they call **\<niw'wiTaam> /niɰʔɰir̥ām/** "waking time." During the early hours, they will eat **\<ruum liasuna> /rūm liaχuna/** "small meal" berries and smoked meats, and begin preparing for their nightly duties within the tribe -- often hunting, fishing, and foraging, though some remain to care for the tribal lands, the pups, and whatever else may need attention in the settlement.

As the sun sets, the main meal of a community is served, **<ri'hual liasuna> /riʔhaul liaχuna/** the "meal of life" which is prepared from the latest kill of the hunters, having been prepared by the **\<ruaMaminku> /ruaмaminku/** "dressers" and *raMukiRan* "cooked slowly" throughout the day over carefully tended embers called the "sleeping fire" **\<ruki'iRan> /rukiʔiʀan/**. When the *ruki'iRan* is stoked and fed to become the **\<niwa'iran> /niɰaʔiʀan/** "awoken fire" it is time to serve the food and make final preparations for the night's work...

During the night, the cooks sleep in shifts and clean the remaining meat off the carcass, preparing to *raMukiRan* (slow cook, smoke) the spare food for further preservation. The watchers keep watch for any dangerous animals -- or visitors from other tribes -- and ensure the pups are able to play and learn in safety.

As everyone returns home to the settlement near dawn, the cooks will ensure a selection of *ruum liasuma* are available for eating, ready to work with the dressers to prepare the kills of hunters and fishers. As the sunlight begins to grow strong, most of the tribe will return to their dens to sleep, with the dressers and cooks staying awake in shifts to ensure nothing goes wrong with the food, and a selection of watchers taking shifts to alert the tribe of any danger or visitors...

:book_mudora: **\<ma'naumu'> /maʔnaumuʔ/** _n._ mating season, rutting season (lit. "growing moon")

A gramurn's first rut usually happens around 12 Atrusian years old (18 Gaean years) and comes with an intense drive and desire to mate and bear offspring. This cycle will happen roughly every 180 days after the last cycle ends, with two milder rutting seasons of about 21 days and one strong season of about 42 days.

While modern Gramurn often go on retreats during these times in order to indulge privately, the early Gramurn celebrated this season as the ideal time for mating and courtship displays, which were not as private as modern practices.

## 11 - Minerals

Did you know that some rocks are useful, even if you have powerful jaws, sharp fangs, and well maintained claws? Well, the Gramurn sure figured it out, and here's a few of the minerals they could use during this era!
