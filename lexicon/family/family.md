Family Terms
------------

At this stage of their culture, the gramurn traced their lineage almost entirely along matrilineal lines. This means that their conception of _true_ siblings and relations is through relationship to the mother, not the father.

#### Ego Generation

Within the generation of the referent ego, siblings (including bimatrilineal cousins) are referred to as _haмi_ for females and _ɢ̆iʔhaк_ for males. The children of one's mother's sisters are considered siblings.

* **[haмi](lexicon/family/haмi)**
	1. (_noun_) _sister_, a female with the same mother, especially from the same litter
	2. (_noun_) _female cousin_, a female born to one's mother's sister
* **[ɢ̆iʔhaк](lexicon/family/ɢ̆iʔhaк)**
	1. (_noun_) _brother_, a male with the same mother, especially from the same litter
	2. (_noun_) _male cousin_, a male born to one's mother's sister

Age relative to the ego can be easily expressed by compounding the words _мuina-_ (old) and _krix-_ (young). Because elder siblings often contribute within their abilities to the rearing of younger siblings, these terms are commonplace, though only to different litters. Birth order within a single litter is considered unimportant, and birth order by litter is important only in direct matrilineal family.

* **мuinaʔhaмi**: 1. _elder sister_, a female with the same mother born to an earlier litter than oneself
* **krixʔhaмi**: 1. _younger sister_, a female with the same mother born to a later litter than oneself
* **мuinaɢ̆iʔhaк**: 1. _elder brother_, a male with the same mother born to a earlier litter than oneself
* **krixɢ̆iʔhaк**: 1. _younger brother_, a male with the same mother born to a later litter than oneself

Patrilineal relations may be referred to by the prefix _namaʔ-_ (like), though the broader context of _namaʔ_ refers to any sibling-like relationship without a matrilineal connection. When specifying that a sibling comes from one's father's side, the word _hur_ (father) may be prefixed to the child-term. Use of _namaʔ_ forms is considered more intimate, while _hur_ forms are more formal.

* **namaʔhaмi**: 1. _like sister_, a female raised as a sibling but without matrilineal relation to oneself
* **namaʔɢ̆iʔhaк**: 1. _like brother_, a male raised as a sibling but without matrilineal relation to oneself
* **hurʔmuxin**: 1. _father daughter_, a female who shares only the same father as oneself
* **hurʔnagur**: 1. _father son_, a male who shares only the same father as oneself

#### Paternal Generation

One's parents are generally easy to refer to: _nin_ is the mother and _hur_ is the father. Lineage is primarily traced through the mother, and her siblings' children are considered almost the same as your mother's own children.

* **nin**: 1. _mother_, the female who gave birth to oneself
* **hur**: 1. _father_, the male who conceived oneself
* **ninʔhaмi**: 1. _aunt (maternal)_, the sister of one's mother
* **ninʔɢ̆iʔhaк**: 1. _uncle (maternal)_, the brother of one's mother
* **hurʔhaмi**: 1. _aunt (paternal)_, the sister of one's father
* **hurʔɢ̆iʔhaк**: 1. _uncle (paternal)_, the brother of one's father

It is generally taboo to mate with any of the above relatives or their children.

A more common term for one's parents' siblings' mates is to prefix _iā_ (big) to the sibling term. This indicates no direct lineage to that individual, only a relationship through mating.

* **iāʔhaмi**: 1. _big sister_, a female mate to one's uncle
* **iāɢ̆iʔhaк**: 1. _big brother_, a male mate to one's aunt

Children are referred to by the terms _muxin_ (daughter) and _nagur_ (son). The children of one's siblings may be referred to with the roots or, if clarity is required, by adding _haмi_ or _ɢ̆iʔhaк_ as a prefix.

* **muxin**: 1. _daughter_, a female born or conceived by oneself 2. neice, a female born or conceived by one's sibling
* **nagur**: 1. _son_, a male born or conceived by oneself 2. nephew, a male born or conceived by one's sibling
* **haмimuxin**: 1. _niece (maternal)_, a female born or conceived by one's sister
* **haмinagur**: 1. _nephew (maternal)_, a male born or conceived by one's sister
* **ɢ̆iʔhaкmuxin**: 1. _niece (paternal)_, a female born or conceived by one's brother
* **ɢ̆iʔhaкnagur**: 1. _nephew (paternal)_, a male born or conceived by one's brother

#### Grandparents' Generation

One's parents' parents are referred to by adding the prefix _iā_ (big) or _мuina_ (old) to the parental term. Maternal ancestors use _iā_, while paternal ancestors use _мuina_, as lineage is important.

* **iānin**: 1. _grandmother (maternal)_, one's mother's mother
* **iāʔhur**: 1. _grandfather (maternal)_, one's mother's father
* **мuinanin**: 1. _grandmother (paternal)_, one's father's mother
* **мuinaʔhur**: 1. _grandfather (paternal)_, one's father's father

Sibling terms may be suffixed to these to create great-aunts and great-uncles.

* **iāninʔhaмi**: 1. _great aunt (maternal)_, one's mother's aunt
* **iāninʔɢ̆iʔhaк**: 1. _great uncle (maternal)_, one's mother's uncle
* **iāʔhurʔhaмi**: 1. _great aunt (paternal)_, one's father's aunt
* **iāʔhurʔɢ̆iʔhaк**: 1. _great uncle (paternal)_, one's father's uncle

Grandchildren are referred to by reduplicating the first syllable nucleus and coda after the first syllable of the child term. Great nephews and nieces are referred to as grandchildren, and no lineal distinction is made in descent.

* **muxʔuxin**: 1. _granddaughter_, the child of one's child
* **nagʔagur**: 1. _grandson_, the child of one's child

#### Older Generations

There is no formally attested way to refer to further generations than grandparents.

#### Non-Lineal Family

Gramurn culture has long been very communal, and so some members of a community without bloodline relationships still fall into very family-like roles. These are often indicated by _namaʔ_ or _krix_ prefixes.

* **krixnin**: 1. _packmother_, a female who cares for young children she is not related to 2. _nurse_, a female who has not given birth but cares for unweaned young children
* **krixʔhur**: 1. _packfather_, a male who cares for young children he is not related to 2. _eunuch_, a male who has not had children but cares for young children

When referring to similarly-aged cohorts within a pack, clan, or village, the terms for _like siblings_ are often used to indicate impersonal closeness

* **namaʔhaмi**: 2. _like sister_, a female of similar age raised communally alongside oneself
* **namaʔɢ̆iʔhaк**: 2. _like brother_, a male of similar age raised communally alongside oneself

Finally, in communal rearing, many adults will have some loose sense of parentage to the children they help raise, and those without a lineal relationship will be referred to as _namaʔ_ children:

* **namaʔmuxin**: 1. _like daughter_, a female unrelated to oneself who has been raised communally by oneself
* **namaʔnagur**: 1. _like son_, a male unrelated to oneself who has been raised communally by oneself

#### Non-Lineal Child Terminology

The following terms are derived from _muxin_ and _nagur_, but are not typically used in an explicitly familial sense.

* **мuinamuxin**: 1. _young woman_, a youth who is old enough to join in adult social activities, generally one who is not yet old enough to mate
* **мuinanagur**: 1. _young man_, a youth who is old enough to join in adult social activities, generally one who is not yet old enough to mate
* **krixmuxin**: 1. _female pup_, a female infant or toddler, especially one who has not yet been weaned
* **krixnagur**: 1. _male pup_, a male infant or toddler, especially one who has not yet been weaned
