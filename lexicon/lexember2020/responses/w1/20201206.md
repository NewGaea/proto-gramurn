"My Jaws Are Ready"

The primary weapon of early gramurn, as predators, was their body, and particularly their jaws, so the early word for their mouth and jaws is also used to refer to their body as a whole...

# HAND & LIMBS

The established word for hands and feet, or paws, is _ɰaiak_, and the paws sit at the ends of the _muʔmak_, a shared word for legs and arms. Especially while hunting, early gramurn would attempt to chase prey on all fours, and so saw little difference between their fore- and hind-limbs. However, one important limb I never named was the **iluɣia**, or tail. In addition, the **ɾīʔnaug**, or claws, had not been named. +2 (2/x)

# HEAD

The **hauʔɾāl** is the top, or front, of the body, and is where the senses of sight, smell, and hearing reside. While covered in **an**, or fur, many gramurn also develop **iliaɻ**, or a mane which covers one or more of the top of the head, the back of the neck, the jaw and front of the neck, or the shoulders and chest. +3 (5/x)

# BLOOD

_ɾaкim_ is the word for blood, and **ningaɾaкim** is draining or letting blood. **ɾaкimīʔ** refers to raw or fresh meat, using the new word **mīʔ** to refer to meat or edible flesh. +3 (8/x)

# STOMACH

The **guʔaum** is the belly, both the underside of the body and the stomach within. **aɣuʔaum** (_in belly_) means that smething is edible or potable, while **ɰaguʔaum** (_jaw belly_) means that something is inedible or likely to come back out the mouth. +3 (11/x)

# TO HEAL

**aʔiālu** is the stem for a salve, ointment, unguent, or draught created with or for medicinal purposes. **anʔuihal** is a preparation made for spiritual or religious purposes. **laumīg** is the act of treating an injury, wound, or other affliction. **ɻenxuʔi** is the process of healing or recovering from any injury, wound, or other affliction. +4 (15/15)

**Running Total: 15 words for the 6th. 70 new words for the month.**

At first I hope to do one or two words per prompt, so reaching an average of 14 words a day so far is really impressing me. To tell the truth, though, I finished this afterdoing my big kinship term list for the 7th, which was nothing new, and a light break, so I didn't even know exactly how far ahead of my goals I would be after this day's prompts.
