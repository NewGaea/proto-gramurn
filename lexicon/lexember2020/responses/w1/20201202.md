I'm working on the lexicon for **Proto-Gramurn** again today. While I have a list of roots and stems, I haven't applied derivational processes to all of them, so this is a chance to expand the vocabulary.

1. ROCK - **miʀ** /miʀ/ *noun stem*; earth, dirt, rock
   1. **ʔiʀanmiʀ** /ʔiʀ: an miʀ/ *noun*; copper, literally "fire earth" 1/x
2. OCEAN - **iāniɣɾaк** /jā niɣ: ɾaк/ *noun*; an ocean or sea, literally "big water"
   1. **gaxum** /ga: xum/ *noun stem*; salt 2/x
   2. **gaxumniɣɾaк** /ga: xum niɣ ɾaк/ *noun*; saltwater 3/x
3. MOUNTAIN - **iāmiʀ** /jā: miʀ/ *noun*; a hill or mountain, literally "big earth"
   1. **ʔiʀaniāmiʀ /ʔiʀaniāmiʀ/** *noun*; a volcano or geyser, literally "fire mountain" 4/x
4. FIELD -  **ɣrauʔmiʀ**  /ɣrauʔ: miʀ/ *noun*; a field, grassland or pasture (see Lexember 2020: Day 1)
   1. **klaumamiʀ** /klau: ma miʀ/ *noun*; farmland, a field of grass or grains 5/x
5. SHORE - ???
   1. **niɣɾaкmiʀ** /niɣɾaкmiʀ/ *noun*; shore, bank, beach, an area of land adjacent to water, literally "water earth" 6/6

Only 6 new words today, but the next two days are off from work so I hope I can get them done earlier in the day going forward.
