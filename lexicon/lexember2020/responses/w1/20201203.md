This is a fun one -- back for more **Proto-Gramurn** word creation, this set will involve some new word stems *and* some words that might not translate precisely to English...

# Flower

At present, there is no word for *flower* in Proto-Gramurn, so we will coin the term **raʔau** to refer to "a flower, blossom, or blossoming herb." There is also a word they consider similar, **narʔku** which will refer to "a mushroom, edible moss or mold, or flower which blooms at night." +2 (2/x)

# Tree

With a pre-existing word stem, **miʔar**, referring to wood or trees, we'll be taking some related words this time. Specifically, we're going to name three common trees in the gramurn environs. Note that because the gramurn do not live on earth, these trees are not given translations, but definitions.

First on the list, **guʔmaʔi** is an evergreen tree with thick branches and trunk, suitable for shelter from rain or snow. Second up is **mʔaura** a deciduous tree commonly used for making spears due to its sturdy branches. The third is **huʔrurun**, a short and squat tree with broad bushy leaves often used to conceal the entrance to a den. +3 (5/x)

# Herb

Starting from **klauma**, or *grain*, the word for herb requires a new root: **ūxanaʔ** refers to a scent, smell, or odour, or the act of smelling. Combine the roots and you can form **ūxanaʔklauma** (literally "smelly grain") to refer to a leaf, stem, or flower that is gathered and used for scent or flavour. The similar term **rukāklauma** (literally "sleep grain") refers to plants, or plant parts, which are used for medicinal or spiritual purposes. +3 (8/x)

# Seed

Seed has its own noun stem: **rūm**. This can also refer to "a small thing" and serves as the derivational prefix for "small or little," as in **rūmmiʀ** meaning *a small stone or a pebble, especially one useful in a sling or for making tools*. Of course, both of these are old words. Of course, I've only used **rūm** as a prefix -- if you were to use it as the stem of a compound word, occurring at the end, you would actually be referring to a seed or something that can become something else.

While the following words are fairly straightforward, they were not generated prior to Lexember: **klaumarūm** is a seed of grain, such as a kernel of corn. **raʔaurūm** is a seed or bulb for a flower or flowering bush. **miʔarrūm** is a seed of a tree. +3 (11/x)

# Vegetable

Another word (and type) that didn't pre-exist. In Proto-Gramurn, the edible fruits of a plant -- whether they are roots or not, are referred to broadly as **laihaʔū**, or food plants. Technically, even *klauma* is a type of **laihaʔū**, but we're going to name three particular crops that were being planted and grown early on. **gaulū** are beans, small edible seeds which grown on a vine and are often grown alongside sturdy *klauma* crops. **мuχai** are "sweet potatoes" for simplicity -- a type of root which is dense and sweet. **χaugal** are any sort of edible plants which retain water or juice. +3 (14/x)

# Conclusion

14 words for the third day is pretty big, especially after only getting a scrawny little *6* words for the second. Maybe the added creativity of the non-earthly ecosystem helped me be a bit more creative? Of course, while their world isn't earth, it is earth-like, including the presence of things we would recognize as plants and animals...
