Verbs in Proto-Gramurn must agree with the subject or actor of the verb. Verbs which are not inflected in any way are considered to be filling a non-verbal role in a sentence, usually as a position or descriptor. All inflection is added to the end of the verb.

|    | SING  | INCL  | EXCL  | PLUR |
|:--:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|
| 1  | a     | ak    | ank   | iʔa  |
| 2  | ia    | lin   | lin   | ilaʔ |
| 3  | u     | ʔu    | au    | aʔu  |

Singular is used for a singular subject, inclusive and exclusive are used to match the second person or dual forms, and plural is used for numbers greater than dual.

In addition to inflecting by person and number, verbs inflect for person and tense: past and present (or non-past). Tense marking follows the personal inflection.

|   | PAST | PRES |
|:-:|:----:|:----:|
| 1 | ʔī   | i    |
| 2 | kua  | ga   |
| 3 | maʔ  | m    |


The full paradigm looks like this:

|   | SG-PAST | SG-PRES | IC-PAST | IC-PRES | EC-PAST | EC-PRES | PL-PAST | PL-PRES |
|:-:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:------:|:--------:|:-------:|
| 1 | -aʔī    | -ai     | -akʔī   | -aki    | -ankʔī  | -anki  | -iʔaʔī   | -iʔai   |
| 2 | -iakua  | -iaga   | -linkua | -linga  | -linkua | -linga | -ilaʔkua | -ilaʔga |
| 3 | -umaʔ   | -um     | -ʔumaʔ  | -ʔum    | -aumaʔ  | -aum   | -aʔumaʔ  | -aʔum   |
