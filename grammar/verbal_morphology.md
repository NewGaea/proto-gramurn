Verbs in Proto-Gramurn must agree with the subject or actor of the verb. Verbs which are not inflected in any way are considered to be filling a non-verbal role in a sentence, usually as a position or descriptor. All inflection is added to the end of the verb.

|     | SING | D.INCL | D.EXCL | PLUR |
| :-: | :--: | :----: | :----: | :--: |
|  1  |  a   |   ak   |  ank   | iʔa  |
|  2  |  ia  |  lin   |  lin   | ilaʔ |
|  3  |  u   |   ʔu   |   au   | aʔu  |
## Person
Proto-Gramurn verbs conjugate for who is performing the verb: The speaker (first person, 1), the interlocutor (second person, 2), and somebody else (third person, 3). Each person has a row in the above chart, with the four numbers which are also distinguishes.
## Number
Proto-Gramurn verbs also conjugate for number, Single, Dual, and Plural. However, verbs indicate clusivity on the dual number in all three persons, making for 4 columns on the person and number chart.
### Singular (SING)
Singular is used whenever the referred person is independent, or is a certain group referred to as a whole. For example, "person" is singular, but oftentimes in Gramurn "hunting band" is also singular, despite being a group. 
### Dual Number and Clusivity
Dual number refers to things which occur in pairs, or with only two participating members. For an English example, "jeans" is an implicitly dual object, as any reference to "jeans" implies "pair(s) of jeans." English, of course, does not have a natural dual number, and can only construct it as a subset of plural forms, as in "pair of jeans" or "the two of us" or even "you two." Gramurn allows dual in all three persons:

#### English Constructions for Dual Pronouns
|     | DUAL.INCLUSIVE           | DUAL.EXCLUSIVE                       |
| --- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| 1   | we, us two<br>me and you | we<br>me and another person          |
| 2   | you two (both here)      | you and that person (who isn't here) |
| 3   | those two (here)         | those two (one not here)             |

Clusivity in Proto-Gramurn is marked on dual pronouns and verbs, and distinguishes whether the second member of a group is currently present (**inclusive**) or non-present (**exclusive**). For more information on dual pronouns, check the [**Pronouns**](grammar/pronouns) chapter of the grammar. The **Inclusive** form of a dual pronoun only applies if both members of the group are present:
#### First Person Clusivity
The first person **inclusive** refers to the speaker and one of their interlocutors, while the first person **exclusive** refers to the speaker and someone who is not currently present.
#### Second Person Clusivity
The second person **inclusive** refers to one of the interlocutors and one other person who is present, while the second person **exclusive** refers to one interlocutor and one person who is not currently present.
#### Third Person Clusivity
The third person refers to a group of two people who are neither the speaker nor the interlocutor, then the **inclusive** refers to a group of two people who are both present, while the **exclusive** refers to a group of two people of whom at least one is not present. In the third person, these two people may be defined by actual proximity or conversational context.



In addition to inflecting by person and number, verbs inflect for person and tense: past and present (or non-past). Tense marking follows the personal inflection.

|   | PAST | PRES |
|:-:|:----:|:----:|
| 1 | ʔī   | i    |
| 2 | kua  | ga   |
| 3 | maʔ  | m    |


The full paradigm looks like this:

|     | SG-PAST | SG-PRES | IC-PAST | IC-PRES | EC-PAST | EC-PRES | PL-PAST  | PL-PRES |
| :-: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :------: | :-----: |
|  1  |  -aʔī   |   -ai   |  -akʔī  |  -aki   | -ankʔī  |  -anki  |  -iʔaʔī  |  -iʔai  |
|  2  | -iakua  |  -iaga  | -linkua | -linga  | -linkua | -linga  | -ilaʔkua | -ilaʔga |
|  3  |  -umaʔ  |   -um   | -ʔumaʔ  |  -ʔum   | -aumaʔ  |  -aum   | -aʔumaʔ  |  -aʔum  |
