Verbs in Proto-Gramurn must agree with the subject or actor of the verb. Verbs which are not inflected in any way are considered to be filling a non-verbal role in a sentence, usually as a position or descriptor. All inflection is added to the end of the verb.

```
    SING  INCL  EXCL  PLUR
1    a     ak    ank   iʔa
2    ia    lin   lin  ilaʔ
3    u     ʔu    au    aʔu
```

Singlar is used for a singular subject, inclusive and exclusive are used to match the second person or dual forms, and plural is used for numbers greater than dual.

In addition to inflecting by person and number, verbs inflect for person and tense: past and present. Tense marking follows the personal inflection.

```
      PAST     PRES
1      ʔī       i
2      kua      ga
3      maʔ      m
```

The full paradigm looks like this:

```
        SING       |       INCL       |       EXCL       |        PLUR
     PAST  |  PRES |   PAST  |  PRES  |   PAST  |  PRES  |    PAST  |  PRES
1    -aʔī   |   -ai  |   -akʔī  |  -aki   |   -ankʔī |  -anki  |   -iʔaʔī  |  -iʔai
2   -iakua  |  -iaga  |  -linkua | -linga  |  -linkua | -linga  |  -ilaʔkua | -ilaʔga
3    -umaʔ  |   -um  |   -ʔumaʔ |  -ʔum   |   -aumaʔ |  -aum   |   -aʔumaʔ |  -aʔum
```
