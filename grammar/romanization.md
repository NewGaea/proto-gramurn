# Romanization Standards

In addition to using the phonetic symbols outlined in the [phonology section](grammar/phonology), this romanization is provided for those who are writing Proto-Gramurn without easy access to the more complex phonetic symbols.

The following tables divide the phonetic notation from the romanization by a pipe between voicelss and voiced symbols, and \<angle brackes> surrounding simplified romanizations. Where possible and necessary, voicing distinctions are preserved in the choice of letters used to represent the sounds in roman script.

#### Table 1: Proto-Gramurn Consonants

|:------------|:------:|:-------:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
| Nasal       |   m    |   n     |       |        |         |
| Stop        |        |         |  k g  |        |  ʔ \<'>    |
| Fricative   |        |         | x \| ɣ \<v\> | χ \<s> \| ʁ \<z> |   h    |

**NOTE: Check documentation for \<t> and convert matching phonetic \<ɾ> to \<ɹ>!**

## Romanization Scheme Goals

### Simple Letters

The romanization scheme is designed to be typed on any standard US or English keyboard, and should be compatible with most, if not all, keyboards which contain the Latin alphabet. It is preferable to avoid diacritics.

### 1:1 Substitutionality

The romanization seeks to make it as easy as possible to substitute the phonetic and romanized version of words by using a single character for every replacement.

### Case Sensitive

This romanization scheme is case sensitive, using Capital letters to represent the trills and long vowels. Capital letters should not be used anywhere else in the romanization, in order to prevent confusion.

When using a proper name in this romanization, it should be typeset in parentheses (or other brackets) rather than being capitalized.
