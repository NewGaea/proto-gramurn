# Syntax

## Simple Sentences

The fundamental syntax of Proto-Gramurn is SVO.

### Simple Sentence

Simple sentences typically consist of a subject and an action, with an optional object of the action.

```ngloss
\ex Minu ɣamarum ʔagaku
\gl minu [min-u] [person-PRM.SG] [person]
	ɣamarum [ɣamar-u-m] [see-3.SG-PRES] [sees]
	ʔagaku [ʔaga-ku] [game.animal-INC.PL] [game animals]
\ft The person sees (the) game-animals.
```

### Descriptor

Descriptors are added before the element they modify.

```ngloss
\ex Minu ɣamarum iā ʔagau
\gl minu [min-u] [person-PRM.SG] [person]
	ɣamarum [ɣamar-u-m] [see-3.SG-PRES] [sees]
	iā [iā] [big] [big]
	ʔagau [ʔaga-u] [game.animal-INC.SG] [game animals]
\ft The person sees (some) big game-animals.
```
#### Postpositional Clause

Positional clauses follow the noun they modify, with a general structure of LOCATION + POSITIONAL. Postpositions function similarly to verbs, and are 0-marked root words.

```ngloss
\ex nax ɣamarai ʔagaku aɣix niɣɾaк
\gl nax [nax] [1.SG] [I] 
	ɣamarai [ɣamar-a-i] [see-1SG-PRES] [see]
	ʔagaku [ʔaga.ku] [game.animal-PRM.PL] [game-animals]
	niɣɾaкaura [niɣɾaкaura] [water-INC.SG] [water]
	aɣix [aɣix] [sit-0] [at]
\ft I see game-animals at the water.
```
## Articles

Articles are optional in Proto-Gramurn -- the word **гa** may be used (and inflected as a noun) as the indefinite article, while **мuina** may be used (and inflected as a noun) as the definite article. Articles (when used) must agree in number and role with their noun, and must be inflected, though they may assume the proper inflection in lieu of the noun which they precede.

### Definite Incidental, Unmarked Noun

```ngloss
\ex nax ɣamarai мuina'aikan līnauʔla
\gl nax [nax] [1S]
	ɣamarai [ɣamar.ai] [see.PRES.SING]
	мuina'aikan [мuina.aikan] [DEF.INC_PL]
	līnauʔla [līnauʔla] [līnau'la]
\ft I see those līnau'la.
```

### Definite Primary, Indefinite Incidental, Fully Marked

```gloss
\ex мuinau krixminu aɣixumaʔ гaaura xɰanʔaura aɣ
\gla мuina.u      krixmin.u      aɣix.u.maʔ   гa.aura       xɰanʔ.aura     aɣix
\glb DEF.PR_SING  child.PR_SING  sit.3S.PAST  IND.INC_SING  field.INC_SING in
\ft The child sat in a field.
```
