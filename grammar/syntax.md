### Simple Sentences ###

The fundamental syntax of Proto-Gramurn is SVO.

**Simple Sentence**

```
min.u        ɣamar.ai         ʔaga.ke
person.3S    see.PRES.SING    game-animal.PLURAL
The person sees the game-animals.
```

Descriptors are added before the element they modify.

**Descriptor**

```
min.u        ɣamar.ai       iā   ʔaga.u
person.SING  see.PRES.SING  big  game-animal.SING
The person sees a big game-animal.
```

Positional clauses follow the noun they modify, with a general PREP + LOCATION structure. Prepostions function similarly to verbs, and may even be 0-marked verbs.

**Postpositional Clause**

```
nax ɣamar.ai       ʔaga.ke             aɣix   niɣɾaк
1S  see.PRES.SING  game-animal.PLURAL  sit.0  water
I see game-animals at the water.
```

## Articles

Articles are optional in Proto-Gramurn -- the word **_гa_** may be used (and inflected as a noun) as the indefinite article, while _мuina_ may be used (and inflected as a noun) as the definite article. Articles (when used) must agree in number and role with their noun, and must be inflected, though they may assume the proper inflection in lieu of the noun which they precede.

**Definite Incidental, Unmarked Noun**

```
min.u    ɣamar.ai       мuina.aikan   līnauʔla
1S.PR_S  see.PRES.SING  DEF.INC_PL    līnau'la
I see those līnau'la.
```

**Definite Primary, Indefinite Incidental, Fully Marked**

```
мuina.u      krixmin.u      aɣix.u.maʔ   гa.aura       xɰanʔ.aura     aɣ
DEF.PR_SING  child.PR_SING  sit.3S.PAST  IND.INC_SING  field.INC_SING in
