Syntax

### Simple Sentences ###

The fundamental syntax of Proto-Gramurn is SVO.

```
min.u        ɣamar.ai         ʔaga.ke
person.3S    see.PRES.SING    game-animal.PLURAL
The person sees the game-animals.
```

Descriptors are added before the element they modify.

```
min.u        ɣamar.ai       iā   ʔaga.u
person.SING  see.PRES.SING  big  game-animal.SING
The person sees a big game-animal.
```

Positional clauses follow the noun they modify, with a general PREP + LOCATION structure. Prepostions function similar to verbs, and may even be 0-marked verbs.

```
nax ɣamar.ai       ʔaga.ke             aɣix   niɣɾaк
1S  see.PRES.SING  game-animal.PLURAL  sit.0  water
