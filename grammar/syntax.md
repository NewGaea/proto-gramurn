# Syntax

## Simple Sentences

The fundamental syntax of Proto-Gramurn is SVO.

### Simple Sentence

Simple sentences typically consist of a subject and an action, with an optional object of the action.

```gloss
\ex Minu ɣamarai ʔagake
\gla minu        ɣamarai         ʔagake
\glb person.3S    see.PRES.SING    game-animal.PLURAL
\ft The person sees the game-animals.
```

### Descriptor

Descriptors are added before the element they modify.

```gloss
\ex minu ɣamarai iā ʔagau
\gla min.u        ɣamar.ai       iā   ʔaga.u
\glb person.SING  see.PRES.SING  big  game-animal.SING
\ft The person sees a big game-animal.
```

**Postpositional Clause**

Positional clauses follow the noun they modify, with a general structure of POSITIONAL + LOCATION. Prepositions function similarly to verbs, and may even be 0-marked verbs.

```gloss
\ex nax ɣamarai ʔagake aɣix niɣɾaк
\gla nax ɣamar.ai       ʔaga.ke             aɣix   niɣɾaк
\glb 1S  see.PRES.SING  game-animal.PLURAL  sit.0  water
\ft I see game-animals at the water.
```

## Articles

Articles are optional in Proto-Gramurn -- the word **_гa_** may be used (and inflected as a noun) as the indefinite article, while _мuina_ may be used (and inflected as a noun) as the definite article. Articles (when used) must agree in number and role with their noun, and must be inflected, though they may assume the proper inflection in lieu of the noun which they precede.

### Definite Incidental, Unmarked Noun

```gloss
\ex minu ɣamarai мuina'aikan līnauʔla
\gla min.u    ɣamar.ai       мuina.aikan   līnauʔla
\glb 1S.PR_S  see.PRES.SING  DEF.INC_PL    līnau'la
\ft I see those līnau'la.
```

### Definite Primary, Indefinite Incidental, Fully Marked

```gloss
\ex мuinau krixminu aɣixumaʔ гaaura xɰanʔaura aɣ
\gla мuina.u      krixmin.u      aɣix.u.maʔ   гa.aura       xɰanʔ.aura     aɣ
\glb DEF.PR_SING  child.PR_SING  sit.3S.PAST  IND.INC_SING  field.INC_SING in
\ft The child sat in a field.
```
