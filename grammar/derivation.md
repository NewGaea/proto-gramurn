Productive Derivations in Proto-Gramurn
=======================================

## Nominal compounding

Within a noun phrase, descriptors attach before the head noun. If two nouns are combined together, such as _grāl_ (wolf) + _min_ (person), the compound _grālmen_ means "wolf person" or "a person who is like or related to a wolf." The similar _graʔmin_ is "a heroic person" or "a masculine person."

Note: In _grālmen_, the /i/ of _min_ has been reduced due to the long vowel in the first syllable, _grāl_. Long vowels and diphthongs are the only way to put stress in the first syllable of a multi-syllable word, which is why _graʔmin_ retains the /i/.

## Descriptive compounding

As above, but when using one or more descriptive words, the most salient word tends to be at the front of the adjectival clause. While nominal compounds tend to add nothing directly, adjectival cluases before a noun will tend to repeat the last vowel of the clause before reaching the noun.

For example, a "big red horse" would be _iāʔarg[a]xikuʔ_ while a "red big horse" would be _argiāxikuʔ_, and they could be different things.

### Alternative readings

When deriving, some adjectival constructions have further meaning. For example, the above _iāʔarg_ "big red"  "red big" construction actually means "more red" or "most red," while the contrasting _argiā_ would always mean that the referent is both "big" and "red."
