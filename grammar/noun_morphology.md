# Noun Morphology 

Nouns inflect for number, singular or plural, and for whether they are a primary or incidental element of a statement.

|            | Singular | Plural |
|:-----------|:--------:|:------:|
| Primary    | -u       | -ku    |
| Incidental | -aura    | -aikan |

Primary nouns represent the subject and direct object of a statement. Incidental nouns represent background information. For example, "At the water, I see game animals," contains the incidental noun _water_ and the primary nouns _I_ and _game animal_. Pronouns, however, do not inflect for these roles.

```gloss
\ex nax ɣamarai ʔagaku aɣix niɣɾaкaura
\gla nax ɣamarai ʔagaku aɣix niɣɾaкaura
\glb 1S  see-PRIM.SING  game.animal-PL  sit.0  water-INC.SING
\ft I see game animals at the water.
```

In addition to marking indirect objects, the incidental is also used as the argument -- whether subject or agent -- of intransitive constructions. If the sun is shining, that's intransitive.
