# Noun Morphology 

Nouns inflect for number, singular or plural, and for whether they are a primary or incidental element of a statement.

|            | Singular | Plural |
|:-----------|:--------:|:------:|
| Primary    | -u       | -ku    |
| Incidental | -aura    | -aikan |

Primary nouns represent the subject and direct object of a statement. Incidental nouns represent background information. For example, "At the water, I see game animals," contains the incidental noun _water_ and the primary nouns _I_ and _game animal_. Pronouns, however, do not inflect for these roles.
